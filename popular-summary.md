Circadian rhythms are internal clocks that organisms use to synchronize their metabolisms to the 24- hour day-night cycle. The molecular-level events that make the clock tick, however, have randomness in their timing, which has made experimental and theoretical scientists wonder how they manage to keep a 24-hour-period. In our work, we used theoretical calculations to add to our understanding of how burning energy in the form of ATP may help to keep the clock on time.
By modeling these clocks as random hopping processes on a ring of states, we were able to treat the problem using mathematical tools called *transfer matrices* which have previously been applied to understand a range of processes including electron localization in conductors and firing neurons. Our theoretical calculations showed that when the model is strongly biased to move in one direction on the ring, which corresponds to burning more energy, many of the details of the model which generally affect the period of the clock stop mattering. As a result, many of the random effects that can throw off the timing of a circadian rhythm can be suppressed by using more energy.
